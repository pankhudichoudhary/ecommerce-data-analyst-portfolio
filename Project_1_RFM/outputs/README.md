# RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Objective
Segment e-commerce customers using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis to identify high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers.

## Python Workflow
The complete data cleaning, RFM scoring, and customer segmentation logic was implemented in Python using Pandas.  
The full workflow is available in the Jupyter notebook: `RFM_Project.ipynb`

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Tableau Public

## What I Did
- Cleaned transaction-level retail data
- Calculated RFM metrics per customer
- Assigned customer segments based on RFM scores
- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize insights

## Key Insights
- Champions generate the highest revenue and purchase frequently
- At Risk and Lost Customers show churn signals
- Potential Loyalists are strong retention opportunities
