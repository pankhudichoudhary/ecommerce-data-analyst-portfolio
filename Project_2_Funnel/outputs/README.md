# E-commerce Conversion Funnel Analysis

## Objective
Analyze drop-offs across the e-commerce funnel and compare conversion performance by device. 

## Tools
- Python
- Tableau Public

## What I Did
- Analyzed funnel stages from session start to order confirmation
- Calculated conversion rates across devices
- Identified high drop-off points in the checkout journey


## Key Insights & Impact
- Mobile users show significantly lower conversion rates compared to desktop users, indicating checkout friction.
- The largest drop-off occurs at the checkout stage, making it the highest-impact area for optimization.
- Simplifying mobile checkout flows (fewer steps, guest checkout, faster payments) is likely to deliver the highest conversion gains.
This analysis can be used by product and growth teams to prioritize mobile checkout improvements.
